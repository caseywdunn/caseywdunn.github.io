description: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/caseywdunn/agalma">Agalma</a> is our multifunctional phylogenetic analysis tool. We use it to build phylogenies from genome and transcriptome data, and to study the evolution of differential gene expression. The photo above is of an Agalma, the siphonophore that this tool is named after.
