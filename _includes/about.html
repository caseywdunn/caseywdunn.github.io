We will move to the <a href="http://eeb.yale.edu">Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</a> at <a href="http://www.yale.edu">Yale University</a> on July 1, 2017.</p>

We are interested in learning about the actual history of life on Earth as well as the general properties of evolution that have contributed to these historical patterns. The type of questions we ask require field (marine), laboratory, and computational work. Our research falls into several domains.</p>

They are colonial - each siphonophore starts as a single embryo that asexually produces many genetically identical, physiologically integrated bodies. The many bodies in a siphonophore are each specialized for particular functions, such as feeding or swimming. We study the morphology, evolution, and development of siphonophores to understand this unique functional specialization.</p>

We develop new methods and tools for understanding phylogenetic relationships, and apply these tools to animals to understand the evolution of complex traits. We are particularly interested in deep animal phylogeny, but also work on subgroups of animals including cnidarians and molluscs.</p>
